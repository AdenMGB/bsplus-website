        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          BetterSEQTA+ ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our browser extension and desktop application (collectively, the "Service").
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          BetterSEQTA+ is a third-party tool designed to enhance the user experience of SEQTA Learn. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Education Horizons Group (the creators of SEQTA).
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">2. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          <strong>We do not collect, intercept, or store your personal school data, login credentials, or academic records on our servers.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          BetterSEQTA+ and DesQTA operate primarily as client-side modifications. This ensures your academic data remains private. To address specific concerns regarding data handling and optional features:
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4 sm:mt-6 text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-white">Login Credentials</h4>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We never capture, store, or transmit your school SEQTA username or password to our servers.
        </p>
        <ul role="list" class="mt-2 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li><strong>BetterSEQTA+ Extension:</strong> Uses your browser's existing active session with SEQTA. It does not see or handle your login credentials directly.</li>
          <li><strong>DesQTA App:</strong> Sends your credentials directly from your device to your school's SEQTA server to authenticate. It does not send this information to us or any third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Data Storage & Cloud Sync (DesQTA Only)</h4>
        <ul role="list" class="mt-2 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> By default, all custom settings, themes, and preferences are stored locally on your device.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional Cloud Sync:</strong> DesQTA offers a completely <strong>optional</strong> cloud sync feature to synchronize your <em>application settings</em> (e.g., themes, custom background preferences) across devices.
            <ul class="ml-6 mt-1 list-[circle]">
              <li>This uses a custom, in-house authentication system separate from your school SEQTA account.</li>
              <li>Only your DesQTA configuration is synced. <strong>No school data, academic records, or SEQTA login credentials are ever uploaded or stored in this cloud service.</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">3. Transparency & Open Source</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          To address concerns regarding data privacy and the inability to "verify" our data handling: <strong>BetterSEQTA+ and DesQTA are fully open-source projects.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          This means our entire codebase is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/" class="text-green-400 hover:text-green-300 underline" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Anyone, including school IT departments and security researchers, can inspect the code to verify that:
        </p>
        <ul role="list" class="mt-3 sm:mt-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>No mechanism exists to capture or export your login credentials.</li>
          <li>No "spyware" or data harvesting code is present.</li>
          <li>The application behaves exactly as described in this policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">4. Accuracy of Academic Information</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          The "Course Average" and predicted grades displayed by BetterSEQTA+ and DesQTA are <strong>estimates</strong> based on the raw data available in your client.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          Please note:
        </p>
        <ul role="list" class="mt-3 sm:mt-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>These calculations are intended as a personal guideline only.</li>
          <li>They may not reflect complex weighting rules, non-linear grading scales, or manual adjustments used by your specific school.</li>
          <li><strong>You should never rely on these figures for official academic standing.</strong> Always refer to your official school reports and the grades published directly by your teachers for accurate results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">5. Analytics</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          We do not employ any in-app analytics or telemetry within the extension or desktop application itself. The only statistics we view are the anonymous, aggregated installation and usage metrics provided automatically by the Chrome Web Store.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          <strong>DesQTA Anonymous Usage Statistics:</strong> DesQTA collects completely anonymous statistics about how many times the application is used. Each time DesQTA is opened, it sends a single, anonymous session count to our servers. This data is completely anonymous and contains no personal information, user identifiers, or any data that could be used to identify individual users. We use this aggregated data solely to understand overall usage patterns and improve the application.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">6. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          Our website and Service may contain links to external sites (such as GitHub or Discord) that are not operated by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">7. Data Security</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          Since BetterSEQTA+ does not store your personal data on our servers, the security of your data is primarily dependent on:
        </p>
        <ul role="list" class="mt-3 sm:mt-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>The security of your own device and browser.</li>
          <li>The security measures implemented by your school's SEQTA installation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
          We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
